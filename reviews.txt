Product: Air Conditioner
Review: The delivery was quick and the AC was delivered 3 days before the date which is impressive.
I got sms about installation booking on the same day and AC was installed next day.
Installation was conducted by two teenage boys who were quiet inexperienced and took almost 5 hours in the whole process, they did try to sell their ODU stand @ ₹850 but I had already arranged iron angle stand made by local iron works shop for about half the price and they (installation guys) installed the ODU on my own stand.

They drilled a hole in the wall for the copper pipes and did not fill it with anything to shut it so I'll have to close it myself with wall putty or something else.

The installation team did not overcharge me for anything as I arranged everything on my own for less than half of their price.
